# Our House

## Description

Our House is a social app which makes enjoyable the process of delegating chores. The app is aimed at people who house share, in particular university students. Users can join a household, post and assign a chore to a housemate and earn points and badges for completing tasks.

The idea for Our House comes from our personal experiences and provides a solution to getting things done!
